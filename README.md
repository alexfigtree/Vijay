App Description:

 ChefWATSONClient        - Is a Diet On the Go (DOGO) mobile application that will enhance user experience of current Chef WATSON web based application.                                              

                                Main objective of the application is help the user build their custom recipe using Chef WATSON's help and guidance.

  Some of most common places this application can be used are:

         1.)  In Hospitals, right next to patients bed, even a NURSE with no knowledge in cooking will be able to take a special order for patient with DIET restrictions.

         2.)  Restaurants with less knowledegable chefs ( but skilled with cooking give recipe) can take custom orders from customers instead of just going with what is there in the menu.

         3.) Ofcourse in every single household this can be one of the best hand held kitchen tool!!!!!

 More details about on the usage and where IBM can implement ChefWATSONClient  ( a.k.a DIET on the GO  or DOGO in short):Click here for a demo of the application

 Option 1 in Hospital - This is an application that can bring ChefWATSON to the finger tips of the Doctor or Nurses who are not DIET specialists but can quickly download this app onto their mobile device and suggest recipes like a professional DIETICIAN customized to the patients' needs.
 

Option 2 in Restaurants -
Of course restaurants can be highly benefited by the Chef Watson’s primary recipe generation logic? The mobile app experience just makes it lot easier and quicker for the WAITER to act like a Super Chef by providing options of recipes instead asking User to pick from a static menu card. This mobile app will open up a dynamic recipe for the customers or restaurants.
 

Option 3 in Senior Care Centers-
Lot of care needs to be given to Senior Citizens; those particularly with DIET restrictions and ChefWATSON can provide the help in this matter. Bringing the mobile App to the Senior Homes to the Nursing Aides and the Chefs in the kitchen will enhance the food experience quickly (using DIET on the GO) for the seniors as ChefWATSON should be able to provide the recipes through lighter mobile app which is easy to carry (with all the wheelchairs it is not easy to carry bulky computers). Even the seniors can suggest the recipe like the way they want and ask the Chef to make it for them they want.

 

Implementation approach:

A mobile application is created using Adnroid technologies. 

ChefWATSON API will be leveraged for handling most of the backbone business requirements.

The front end UI will be built on Android based devices.

 

Cognitive elements:

WATSON Q&A, Chef WATSON API
